# react-next-boilerplate

Welcome to our React/Next boilerplate, we are really anxious to start a new app development using these technologies.
So we are inviting you to ride with us on this document to learn how to grow up your app scratching from here.

[Let's do it together!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)

## Getting Started

### First step - Run the boilerplate

So, in the first moment you should clone this repo into your work dir:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:CheesecakeLabs/react-next-boilerplate.git
```

ok, now we have a copy of `react-next-boilerplate`, let's rename it:

```sh
$ mv react-next-boilerplate <project-name>
```

and go there...

```sh
$ cd <project-name>
```

Now, we are ready to serve our dev server, to do this, please run this command:
```sh
$ yarn dev
```
